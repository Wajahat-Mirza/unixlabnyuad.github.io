I also took FOS), and feel free to talk to me if you're interested in working at the Gazelle as a web dev. When I'm not in the lab, you can probably find me on the volleyball court or in the Arts Center. Come say hi!",

Aside from helping you with the normal CS course stuff, I've dabbled in Front-End(HTML,CCS,JS) and am learning Golang at the moment.

Feel free to come talk to me about anything CS related, or if you need help with Python, Javascript, C++, Data Science (particularly NLP), or Full-Stack Web Development. Otherwise, I can be found taking photos at events and stuffing myself with free food wherever I find it. You'll recognize me from my big curly hair.",
