Double-majoring in Math so I could also try to work through some proofs with you if you're stuck with Discrete. Outside the academic realm, I love working and talking about startup projects/ideas. So, if you have an interesting idea you want to run by me, come through!",

Apart from helping you with intro classes and CS basics, I am more than happy to discuss about full-stack web development (MERN stack), agile, database design and query languages (SQL(ite), MongoDB) or even about study-away recommendations for New York and Shanghai.",
